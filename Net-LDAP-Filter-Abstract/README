NAME
    Net::LDAP::Filter::Abstract - Generate LDAP filters using a simple API

SYNOPSIS
      my $filter = Net::LDAP::Filter::Abstract->new('&');
      $filter->add(qw/objectClass = person/);
      $filter->add(qw/uid = dwc/);
      print $filter->as_string;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an API for generating LDAP filter strings. It is
    intended to simplify the process of generating complex filters by
    avoiding messy string manipulation.

    LDAP filters are typically represented as trees. Thus, this module
    provides tree manipulation routines written with LDAP filters in mind.

METHODS
  new
    Create a new LDAP filter. Optionally, provide an operator (see OPERATORS
    below). If none is specified, the default ("&") is used.

      my $filter = Net::LDAP::Filter::Abstract->new;

  add
    Add an operator or predicate to this LDAP filter.

      # Create an operator
      my $filter2 = Net::LDAP::Filter::Abstract->new('!');

      # Add a predicate
      $filter2->add(qw/uid = dwc/);

      # Add the full predicate to the tree
      $filter->add($filter2);

  as_string
    Generate the LDAP filter string from the current tree.

      print $filter->as_string;

  _node
    Private method to generate a node in the filter's tree.

OPERATORS
    *   "&" - logical and

    *   "|" - logical or

    *   "!" - logical not
