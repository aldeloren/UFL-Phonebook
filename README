Run script/ufl_phonebook_server.pl to test the application.

To test the private version of the application, you will need the appropriate
keytab for principal 02010600/app/phonebook and the corresponding configuration
file.  Name this ufl_phonebook_private.yml and then pass the environment
variable to the server as below:

UFL_PHONEBOOK_CONFIG_LOCAL_SUFFIX=private REMOTE_USER=dwc@ufl.edu glid=dwc ufid=12345678 cn="Daniel Westermann-Clark" ./script/*server.pl -r -d
