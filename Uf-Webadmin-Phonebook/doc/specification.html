    <h1>University of Florida Phonebook</h1>
    <h2>Functional Specification</h2>

    <h3>About this Specification</h3>
    <p>(This specification is based on the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/AardvarkSpec.html">Project Aardvark specification</a> from Joel Spolsky.)</p>
    <p>This specification is simply a starting point for the design of the University of Florida (UF) Phonebook, not a final blueprint. As the project progresses, we'll discover a lot of things that won't work exactly as planned. We'll invent new features, change things, etc. We'll try to keep the spec up to date as things change.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Throughout this document, &quot;Phonebook&quot; refers to the Web site, while &quot;Directory&quot; refers to the backend database which the Phonebook uses.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://phonebook.ufl.edu/">current UF Phonebook</a> is maintained by <a href="http://www.circa.ufl.edu/">CIRCA</a>. However, the lead developer retired and thus the application has not been updated for a few years. Searching for people is sometimes difficult, for example, when you don't know exactly how to spell a person's name. Searching for departments is not possible, even though this information is available in the <a href="http://www.bridges.ufl.edu/directory/">UF Directory</a>.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the site uses an old version of the UF Web site template, which does not follow aesthetic and accessibility standards implemented on campus-wide services by <a href="http://www.webadmin.ufl.edu/">Web Administration</a>.</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>The user visits the Phonebook Web site to find a student, faculty, or staff member.</li>
      <li>The user enters some identifying information about this person.</li>
      <li>The application provides one or more results to the user, or a message saying that no results were found.
    </ol>

    <h3>Major Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to find people:
        <ul>
          <li>No mention of wildcards. Where possible, substring searches are performed by default.</li>
          <li>Results displayed in a clean layout, with most commonly used details right there.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When no results are found, suggestions on how to proceed are provided.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design Goals</h3>
    <p>All design and engineering decisions will be made with the following principle in mind:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Simple is better than complicated.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We will always try to eliminate choices that the user must make. No jargon relating to the implementation of the Directory will be part of the user experience.</p>

    <h3>About the Rollout</h3>
    <p>Our primary goal is to have a mostly functional version of the Phonebook in two weeks. That means that the initial version will be suboptimal in many ways and will not contain every feature. Throughout this specification, the notation (v2) will be used to indicate features which will not be a part of the initial rollout but added later.</p>

    <h3>Software Architecture</h3>
    <p>The Web application will be written in Perl using the <a href="http://catalyst.perl.org/">Catalyst</a> framework.</p>
    <p>Web pages will be written using the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Toolkit/">Template Toolkit</a>. CSS will be used for formatting and positioning, following the standards put in place by Web Administration.</p>
    <p>To interface with the Directory, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl-ldap/">Net::LDAP</a> will be used.</p>

    <h3>The User Experience</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Future Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>(hopefully v1) &quot;Internal phonebook&quot;, requiring GatorLink authentication and returning results using the user's credentials.</li>
      <li>(v2) Google Suggest-style completions for phonebook queries. When the user types a few characters, display ten or so results from the Directory that might match.</li>
      <li>(v2) Strings will be isolated for easy localization (for e.g. a Spanish version of the site).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Planned Pages</h3>

    <h4>The Home Page</h4>
    <p></p>

    <h4>The People Search Page</h4>
    <p></p>

    <h4>The People Results Page</h4>
    <p></p>

    <h4>The People Details Page</h4>
    <p></p>

    <h4>The Unit Search Page</h4>
    <p></p>

    <h4>The Unit Results Page</h4>
    <p></p>

    <h4>The Unit Details Page</h4>
    <p></p>
