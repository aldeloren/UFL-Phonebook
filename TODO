* Add tests all over the place
* Refactor
  * See TODO notes in source
  * C::People and C::Units very similar -> move common stuff to a base
    controller?

* Link from unit to people in that unit
* Keep query variable on all pages?
* Improve Entry class to provide a better API
  * Maybe an Entry base class, then subclass Entry::LDAP for the LDAP server
* Display permanent address in addition to local address
